Introduction
------------

Ignition is a research code for defining domain specific languages useful for
high performance computing (HPC).  The goal of the project is to lower the
barriers-of-entry for none HPC experts who want to use the power of the HPC
resources.

Currently, the project has a reference language and generator for integral
equations, called IntGen.  We are also working on an automation engine for the
FLAME project that includes dense and sparse linear algebra methods.

In the future we hope to add more application areas to the project.  The next
area of interest will most likely be finite element algorithms.
