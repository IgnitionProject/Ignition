Installation
============

------------
Requirements
------------

Currently the Ignition project relies on `SymPy`_ v0.6.7 for symbolic algebra
and `Mako`_ v0.3.6 for printing.  Before installing Ignition, it is recommended
to get the `development version of SymPy`_, but Mako can be installed with
``easy_install mako``.

--------
Download
--------

Go to the `Project Page`_ on GitHub. You can either download the source
by hitting the large downloads button or use git to checkout the repository.

-------
Install
-------

Inside the source, the INSTALL file gives detailed instructions.  Currently the
library is mostly written in Python which gives two basic install.


User or global install
----------------------

This is done with the usual Python distutils with the command ``python setup.py
install``

In source install
-----------------

Since the code is pure Python you can add the source directory to the
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.  No code needs to be moved or compiled for
this option.
