Installation
============

------------
Requirements
------------

Currently the Ignition project relies on `SymPy`_ for symbolic algebra,
`Numpy`_ for the FLAME language, `Mako`_ for printing.  Before installing
Ignition, one must install the `development version of SymPy`_, but
Mako can be installed with ``easy_install mako``.

--------
Download
--------

Go to the `Project Page`_ on GitHub. You can checkout the repository using git.

For example
    ~/ $ git clone git://github.com/aterrel/ignition.git

-------
Install
-------

Inside the source, the INSTALL file gives detailed instructions.  Currently the
library is mostly written in Python which gives two basic install.


In source install
-----------------

Since the code is pure Python you can add the source directory to the
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.  No code needs to be moved or compiled for
this option.

For example:
  * Clone both ignition and sympy from their respective dev repos:

    Sympy: https://github.com/sympy/sympy
    Ignition: https://github.com/aterrel/ignition

    .. code-block:: bash

        ~/ $ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git
        ~/ $ git clone git://github.com/aterrel/ignition.git

  * Add the directories to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ~/ $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/ignition:$PWD:sympy:$PYTHONPATH

  * go to iginition/demo/riemann and run a demo

    .. code-block:: bash

        ~/ignition/demo/riemann $ python acoustics.py



User or global install
----------------------

This is done with the usual Python distutils with the command ``python setup.py
install``
