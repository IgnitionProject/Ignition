Installation
------------

Go to the `Project Page`_ on GitHub. You can either download the source
by hitting the large downloads button or use git to checkout the repository.

Inside the source, the INSTALL file gives detailed instructions.  Currently the
library is mostly written in Python which gives two basic install.

User or global install
    This is done with the usual Python distutils with the command ``python
    setup.py install``

In source install
    Since the code is pure Python you can add the source directory to the
    ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.  No code needs to be moved or compiled
    for this option.
