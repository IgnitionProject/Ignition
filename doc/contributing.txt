Contributing
============

Ignition currently uses `GitHub`_ for all hosting of issues and source code.
Feel free to fork and submit patches to the `project page`_.

Contributions to docs
---------------------

All contributions are welcome. If you'd like to improve something, look into
the sources if they contain the information you need (if not, please fix them),
otherwise the documentation generation needs to be improved (look in the
``doc/`` directory).
