Contributing
============

Ignition currently uses `GitHub`_ for all hosting of issues and source code.
Feel free to fork and submit patches to the `project page`_. For more
information on how this work I recommend reading the Github help pages.

  | http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ - Tells you how to fork
  | http://help.github.com/pull-requests/ - Tells you a bit about sending pull requests.

I think github has really nice documentation but there are lots of git
help around the web.  I look forward to seeing your contributions!


Contributions to docs
---------------------

All contributions are welcome. If you'd like to improve something, look into
the sources if they contain the information you need (if not, please fix them),
otherwise the documentation generation needs to be improved (look in the
``doc/`` directory).
