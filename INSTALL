Global install
--------------

To install ignition, type

   sudo python setup.py install

In source install
-----------------

Since the code is pure Python you can add the source directory to the
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.  No code needs to be moved or compiled for
this option.

For example:
  * Clone both ignition and sympy from their respective dev repos:

    Sympy: https://github.com/sympy/sympy
    Ignition: https://github.com/aterrel/ignition

    ~/ $ git clone git://github.com/sympy/sympy.git
    ~/ $ git clone git://github.com/aterrel/ignition.git

  * Add the directories to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

    ~/ $ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/ignition:$PWD:sympy:$PYTHONPATH

  * go to iginition/demo/riemann and run a demo

    ~/ignition/demo/riemann $ python acoustics.py
